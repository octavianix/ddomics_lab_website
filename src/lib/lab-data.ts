      "Longitudinal study of maternal gut, milk and skin microbiomes and their role in establishing a healthy infant microbiome.",
    image: artGut,
    detail:
      "The development of microbiome in infant occurs through mother-infant axis during or after the birth. First few days of life represent a crucial window of opportunity for shaping the development of the gastrointestinal tract and immune system, as well as the adult microbiome. But any dysbiosis during the development of microbiome in new-born can cause IBD, obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease and other long-term lifestyle disorders. The initial exposure of microbes in infant is said to begin during pregnancy through intra-uterine passage (fetal membranes, umbical cords, amniotic fluids) followed by the mode of delivery and by the type of feeding (breast feeding/ formulae fed) given to the infant. Breast milk is one of the continuous sources of mutually beneficial bacteria that are hypothesized to seed the infant’s gut via breastfeeding. It is believed that bacteria from mother’s gut translocate to breast milk via an entero-mammary pathway and thereby populate the infant’s oral and gut subsequently. Whereas, another hypothesis suggests the retrograde flux where a backward movement of milk occurs due to infant suckling and transfers the bacteria from infant’s mouth into the mother’s mammary gland. Mother’s breast milk serves as an important component in shaping the health of infant short term and long term as it harbours ideal balance of nutrients and the abundance of microbes which further acts as perfect food and an optimum medium for growth and development of immunity. Among all bioactive components present in milk, HMOs (Human Milk Oligosaccharides) presents chemical, microbial and medical importance. HMOs form a category of nondigestible, unconjugated, multifunctional and structurally glyans which resist gastrointestinal hydrolysis by gastric acidity and are not absorbable in significant amounts. Thus, allows HMOs to reach infant gut and produce a variety of beneficial effects. HMO’s acts as substrate for various useful bacteria like Bifidobacterium sp. where they are fermented in intestine. Apart from the nutritional role of HMOs in the intestinal microbiota of infants, there is increasing evidence that their interaction with pathogens is important in terms of reducing infection, for example HMOs exhibit bacteriostatic properties against group B Streptococcus (GBS). HMOs play a valuable role in development and maturation of the immune response by activating the expression of multiple cytokines and chemokines, adhesion molecules and receptors, thus maturing the naive immunity in infants. Any deviant in early microbial colonization in new-borns may lead to autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, atopy, and other severe health conditions. It is known, that mother microbiome serves as reservoir in transmitting the microbes to infants. However, the exact source and route of infant pioneering microbes are poorly understood. Hence, to address this we propose a study of how different body sites of mother help in shaping the early microbiome of infant. The proposed longitudinal study will compare the effect of different maternal microbial communities (gut, breast milk and areolar skin) on the development of infant’s gut and oral microbiome. Moreover, to address this we have proposed an animal study of how different body sites of mother Balb/c mice help in shaping the early microbiome of infant mice. The proposed longitudinal study will compare the effect of different maternal microbial communities (gut, breast milk and areolar skin) on the development of infant’s gut and oral microbiome through high throughput species level targeted metagenomics (16S rRNA gene sequencing). For this purpose, fluorescently tagged specific bacterial stains will be transformed with a plasmid and subsequently, the transformed strains will be orally administered to pregnant mice. This mice model will allow the visualization, isolation, and detection of the transformed bacteria in different body locations, including mammary tissue and milk and hence reinforcing the hypothesis that physiological translocation of maternal bacteria during pregnancy and lactation may contribute to the composition of the microbiota of infant mice.",

      "Our main goal is to understand how the microbiome present in the gastrointestinal tract affects neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder. Microbes in the body produce secondary metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids that directly regulate brain gene expression, and we quantify these alongside community profiles to trace plausible mechanistic links. During the last decade or so, clinical as well as animal studies linked gut microbiota with many psychiatric disorders. Gut microbial dynamics is an enormously strong, intrinsic, biologically active non-genetic factor. It may be suggested that the microbiota may undertake epigenetic events through its impact on metabolism. In the current study, we are aiming to investigate the possibility of gut microbial changes affecting the brain epigenetic events which could be leading to regulation of downstream target genes implicated in neuronal communication and synaptic plasticity using rodent animal model. With the importance of epigenetics in shaping the experience-induced brain functions, it is paramount to establish the link, in gut microbiota and brain epigenetics. Our goal is to identify the epigenetic signatures of neuronal plasticity drawn in by gut microbiota with potential probiotic characteristics in the neurocircuitry of emotion and cognition, i.e., amygdala and hippocampus. Whole genome-wide epigenetic changes and whole metagenomic sequencing will be employed to establish the correlations in the gut microbiome and epigenetic changes in the brain of behaving animals. In addition, the observations drawn through these studies will be further employed to draw the mechanistic molecular model operative in behavioural implications of probiotics. ",

    bio: "I am a microbiome researcher interested in understanding the human body as a dynamic ecosystem in which microbes, host physiology, diet, and metabolites continuously interact to shape health across the human lifespan. My work brings together microbiology, metagenomics, nutrition, physiology, and microbial ecology to study the human microbiome from its earliest beginnings to its complex dynamics in adulthood, and ultimately to explore how these microbial ecosystems can be translated into therapeutic and nutritional applications. As part of my PhD research, I investigate mother–infant microbial dynamics, with a particular focus on the potential entero-mammary pathway and other routes of early microbial acquisition. Breast milk is both a nutritional resource and a complex biological interface between mother and infant, carrying microbes, metabolites, and bioactive components that may influence the establishment of the infant gut ecosystem. I study these interactions across mother, breast milk, and infant compartments to understand how microbial communities are transferred, assembled, and functionally shaped during early life. Apart from this, I have been closely involved in the Indian Human Microbiome Initiative (IHMI), a flagship Government of India program, from its sampling phase through large scale microbiome data generation and analysis across diverse Indian populations. My broader work spans both culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches, including next-generation sequencing, metagenomics, microbial community analysis, anaerobic microbial isolation and cultivation, genomic characterization, and the development and application of potential probiotics.",

  about:
    "Dr. Dhiraj Dhotre is a bioinformatician with a research interest in the human microbiome. His lab investigates the role of the human microbiome in health and disease using genomics, metabolomics and culturomics approaches. He believes it is crucial to study the taxonomic, functional and metabolic structure of the microbiome to understand the true potential and consequences of alterations within it. His group generates high-throughput sequencing data and combines computational analyses of multi-dimensional omics data with molecular and in-vivo experimentation to understand the potential of the human microbiome in diagnostics and therapeutics.",
